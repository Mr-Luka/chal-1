/* INSTRUCTIONS
- Create a constructor to create a Player object with a name
- Player should have a name as well as a LVL set to 1 by default and points set to 0 by default
- Create a method on the prototype called gainXp that takes in a number from 1-10
and adds it to the players points. If the current points are >= 10 then add 1 to the lvl
and decrement the points by 10
- Create another prototype method called describe that displays the players stats (name, lvl, points).
