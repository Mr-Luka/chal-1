/*              XMLHttp Request Object
A build in browser object that allows us to make HTTP requests. We can make requests to
servers without having to refresh the page. This allows us to make our webpages much more
dynamic.
These days, you will be usin the fetch API over XHR, however, Its still important to know 
how to use it.
