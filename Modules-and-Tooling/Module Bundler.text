What is a Module Bundler?

A module bundler is a tool that takes all of your source code, which is usually multiple files
and bundles them together, often times into a single build file.

using: webpack
you are creating like a boiler plate dev environment that you can use for future projects.

(loaders - are used to proccess different type of files, and convert them into modules that can be 
used by our application).
